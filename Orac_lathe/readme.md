2.1.1.4. Boxford Lathe ATC toolchanger component
Component controls 8 station ATC fitted to Boxford 240, 160 and 125 
Works on degrees of movement, with ATC defined as rotary axis, so does not require index sensors. 
Should be able to be adapted for any lathe using a 'rotate past pawl and reverse to lock' methodology. 
Amount of rotation configurable for fine tuning, see README and notes in .comp file for details
